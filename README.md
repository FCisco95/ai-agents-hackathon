# CVEX AI Trading Agents Hackathon

## Challenge Overview
Build innovative AI agents that enhance trading on the CVEX platform. Based on our reference implementation, we've proven that CVEX API integration for AI agents is feasible and straightforward. Now we challenge you to take it further!

## Reference Implementation Highlights
Our reference project demonstrates three key capabilities:
1. **CVEX CLI with Trusted Mode API**: Configure account access, retrieve data, estimate and execute trades
2. **Natural Language Trading**: Process plain English instructions through OpenAI to craft, estimate and execute trades
3. **AI-Powered Market Analysis**: Analyze opportunities across markets and accounts, with ability to execute suggested trades

## Implementation Formats
While our reference is a CLI, your solution could be:
* Web application
* Mobile app
* Telegram/Discord bot
* Voice assistant
* Desktop application
* Command-line tool
* Or any other creative interface

## Challenge Tracks

### 1. Advanced Trading Agents
Enhance the reference implementation with more sophisticated trading strategies, additional AI models, or improved decision-making logic.

### 2. Creative User Interfaces
Build intuitive interfaces that make CVEX trading more accessible through natural language, visual tools, or other innovative approaches.

### 3. Specialized Analysis Tools
Create focused tools that provide deeper insights for specific trading scenarios, market conditions, or contract types on CVEX.

### 4. Integration Solutions
Develop solutions that integrate CVEX trading with external data sources, platforms, or services to enhance trading decisions.

## Requirements
All submissions must:
* Integrate directly with CVEX Trusted Mode API
* Include at least one AI component (NLP, ML, predictive analytics, etc.)
* Demonstrate actual trading capabilities (order creation, position management)
* Include a working demo

## Judging Criteria
